      Imagine you have to build a web app which could be a social media website,
      an e-commerce site or an online game etc. Normally you host it in the
      cloud or in your own data centre. At the beginning you see that it is
      working perfect, usually due to the low traffic. As time passes, the
      number of people visiting the web page increases. If this increases
      drastically, you will notice that your pages have slowed down and the
      customers are unhappy with your service which results in your sales going
      down. Here you wouldn’t know where to begin or how to fix it. This is
      where
      <a href="https://newrelic.com/" class="cx bu iz ja jb jc">New Relic</a>
      comes to your aid.

      New Relic is a web application performance service designed to work in a
      real time with your live web app. New Relic Infrastructure provides
      flexible, dynamic server monitoring. Infrastructure empowers modern
      operation teams to make intelligent decisions about complex systems, from
      a physical datacenter to thousands of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon
      EC2) or Microsoft Azure instances. Think of it as a performance dashboard
      with X-ray vision. It lets you see deep inside your web application with
      respect to the end user’s experience within the app itself, down to the
      line of code. New Relic takes the pain of monitoring, troubleshooting and
      scaling the web app, away from your hands and makes it easy to you. You
      can see the important performance data of your app in New Relic, like
      browser response time by geography and browser type, web transactions in
      real time etc. New Relic works with all the different web development
      languages and so compatibility is not an issue. New Relic works as a
      service so that you can access it from anywhere and anytime. It can be
      considered as the plumbing that makes web apps run faster.

      New Relic Insights uses data from New Relic’s other products and uses it
      to analyse user behaviour, business transactions, customer insights, and
      more. Insights help people to visualise trends, create real time
      dashboards and customisable charts for your metrics. It aids the users by
      helping them build better apps and make better decisions. Using the
      Insights interface, you can quickly and easily build dashboards to
      identify problems with your apps and hosts in real-time or to track
      ongoing data trends.

      New Relic has an agent, which is small piece of code which sits inside the
      web application and watches what the web page code is building while it’s
      building web pages. The agent measures how long the code takes to build
      the web page and reports it back to the user. It informs the user the time
      taken for a page to load and specifies if any factors are delaying the
      process. It displays the load time for users all across the globe
      accessing the web application and it follows it all the way down, right to
      the code. So the user will be able to determine if the longer load time is
      caused by something in your server, code, network, or in the browser etc.
    </p>

      All the performance metrics on the dashboard are presented by New Relic.
      You don’t have to customise any of it. You can drill down on the “browser
      page load time” to the amount of time the web application, network, DOM
      processing, page rendering etc take at various instance of time. You can
      optimise your code and then take a relook at how it’s performing now by
      comparing it with the historical data in New Relic. You can also see if
      somebody has deployed a new code along with the browser page load time and
      check if it affected the load time.

        External Service Call recording — whenever you make calls to other
        services from within you app (e.g. an HTTP request to an API like
        Twitter), New Relic will monitor these as external calls. Often these
        external services can significantly degrade the performance of your app,
        especially if you make these calls in-process. New Relic can show which
        of your external calls are slowest, which ones you call the most and
        which respond the slowest on average.
